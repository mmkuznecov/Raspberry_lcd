# HISTORY:

I searched a lot on internet and I couldn't find a single library for my 128x64 LCD display (I was only finding OLED ones), until I found this czech site, with a working code for my LCD. The problem is, that it was in czech.

This repository is an open source project to translate it, and to improve it.


# THE LIBRARY:

The library is working, most is in english, and almost everything you can understand.

This new code also adds new functions, for drawing and to improve the performance of it.

There is also a python3 version of the library that I ported, but as I tested, it is something like 25~30% slower than the python2 version (tested in defaults pythons that comes with the ~august version of Raspbian), so I won't update it anymore. 


## New functions:

#### drawGenericLine

The original code only had drawHorizontal and vertical lines, so I coded this, a function that draw from a coord to another.

#### drawCircle

Yeap, it draws a circle.

#### drawRadiusLine

Draws a line like a clock hand, where you enter the initial coordinate, the angle

in degrees and the radius (the size of the line)

#### printString3x5

The 12864 LCD have a built-in display text function, but the chars are big (16x8 pixels each char, max of 20x4 chars in screen).

The original version of this code had a smaller version of text (8x8 pixels each char), but for my purposes they were still big.

So I coded this function, which prints small chars, 3x5 pixels each char.

Maybe on future I do the 3x3 pixels function haha


There are also some new minor functions on code, but not very useful.
